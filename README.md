GreatCircle is an iOS framework that provides a set of extensions to the `CLLocation` class.

#### The Problem

The CLLocation class provides only one method: 

``- (CLLocationDistance)distanceFromLocation:(const CLLocation *)location``

For calculating the distance between two GPS locations. Because of this, iOS developers must "roll their own" to solve more complex GPS location calculation 
problems.

#### The Solution

[GreatCircle](https://github.com/softwarenerd/GreatCircle) - which is based on the amazing work of [Chris Veness](https://github.com/chrisveness), the owner 
of the [Geodesy functions](https://github.com/chrisveness/geodesy) project - provides a comprehensive set of extension methods to the `CLLocation` class that
make working with GPS locations and performing calculations on then simple and easy.

(For a more general introduction, see: [Movable Type Scripts Latitude / Longitude Calculations Reference](http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html))

#### Status

Thus far, I have worked on porting the spherical-earth model, which provides simple formulae covering the accuracy requirements of most use cases.

## Getting Started

GreatCircle should be used via [Carthage dependency manager](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage). (Why no Cocoapod? I've switched my work to Carthage. [Here's why.](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#differences-between-carthage-and-cocoapods))

#### Add GreatCircle to your Cartfile

```github "softwarenerd/GreatCircle" "master"```

(Until GreatCircle is released, there are no tagged versions, so please use the ```master``` branch.)

#### Update Carthage

```carthage update```

#### Add GreatCircle.framework to Linked Frameworks and Libraries

#### Add Copy Frameworks Run Script

Add a run script that uses the ```carthage copy-frameworks``` command to copy the ```GreatCircle.framework```

*Extension Methods*

**`-crossTrackDistanceToStartLocation:endLocation:`**   
Returns the cross track distance (in meters) of this location relative to the specified start location and end location.

**`-crossTrackLocationToStartLocation:endLocation:`**   
Returns a location representing the cross track point of this location relative to the specified start location and end location.

**`-distanceToOtherLocation:`**   
Returns the distance (in meters) between this location and the other location.

<img src="Documentation/DistanceDiagram.png" alt="DistanceMethod" height="200"/>

**`-finalBearingToOtherLocation:`**   
Returns the final bearing (in degrees) between this location and the other location. The final bearing is the initial bearing from 
the other location to this location reversed 180Â°. The final bearing will differ from the initial bearing by varying degrees according 
to distance and latitude.

**`-initialBearingToOtherLocation:`**   
Returns the initial bearing (in degrees) between this location and the other location.

**`+intersectionOfLocation:andBearing:withLocation:andBearing:`**   
Returns a location representing the point of intersection of two paths, each specified by a location and bearing. Returns nil if 
the two paths do not cross.

**`-isEqualToOtherLocation:`**   
Compares this location to the other location for equality.

**`-locationWithBearing:distance:`**   
Returns a location representing the point that lies at the specified bearing and distance from this location.

<img src="Documentation/BearingDistanceDiagram.png" alt="BearingDistance" height="70"/>

**`-midpointToOtherLocation:`**   
Returns a location representing the midpoint between this location and the other location.
